# Functionality Adding Project

This project is constructed to add a web functionality using Flask for backend and Vue.js for frontend using data offered by Torre's API. The app will consist of 3 new functionalities that are implemented in the backend that can be found at the https://github.com/rafaelfrieri1/FunctionalityAddProject repository, and that can be used from the frontend found at this repository.

- The first functionality will be "Trending Skills" which will consist of a small dashboard showing which are the most seeked skills by job opportunities at Torre.co. Many people can't find a job easily and would like to learn what jobs are expecting for them to know, then a good starting point could be looking at the statistics (They don't lie!).

- The second functionality will be the "Search for Recruiters" functionality. Among recruiters, one of the most time taking tasks is searching for job talent. That's why, with this functionality recruiters can introduce a job ID and receive a list of possible candidates that could fit for the job (based on their skills). This list of candidates is extracted from a random sample (sized 10000) from the users database at Torre.co.

- The third functionality will be "Unpopular Audiences". This third functionality permits the visualization of the most unpopular areas and/or skills at torre.co. As it is intended to attract more people daily to the platform, it is needed to know which are the weakest audiences so future platform enhances are oriented on covering a bigger market.
